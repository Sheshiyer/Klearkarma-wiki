**No Standardized Outcomes Measurement**
Industry lacks quantifiable metrics to assess session effectiveness, leaving clients with only subjective experiences.

Geographic barriers and high costs prevent many from accessing skilled healers and transformative practices.

**Fragmented Experience**
Seekers must navigate multiple platforms, lack integrated booking, payment, and outcome tracking systems.
